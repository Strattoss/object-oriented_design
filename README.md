# Object-Oriented Design

This repository contains the materials for my college-level course on Object-Oriented Programming. The course is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of OOP design concepts and principles using the Java programming language.

## Laboratories

Throughout the course, there were six laboratories, each covering essential topics related to Object-Oriented Programming. In each laboratory, I have worked on exercises and provided solutions to showcase my progress. Below is an overview of the topics covered in each laboratory and the design patterns included:
1. [CRC Cards and UML](lab1)
In this lab, I learned about Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC) cards, a technique used to identify and organize classes, responsibilities, and collaborations in a software system. I also gained knowledge of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize and document class relationships.

1. [Making Changes to the Application](lab2)
This lab focused on making changes to existing code without introducing bugs or breaking the functionality of the application. I delved into version control systems, code review practices, and managing codebase changes.

1. [Refactoring](lab3)
In this lab, I explored the concept of refactoring, which involves improving the design and structure of code without changing its external behavior. I learned common refactoring techniques to make code more maintainable and easier to understand.

1. [Unit Tests](lab4)
Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development. In this lab, I learned how to write unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual units (e.g., methods, functions) of my code. Topics covered included test-driven development (TDD) and testing frameworks.

1. [Design Patterns I](lab5)
Design patterns are essential for creating flexible and reusable software designs. In this lab, I studied the following design patterns:

   * Builder: Used to construct complex objects step by step.
   * Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
   * Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

1. [Design Patterns II](lab6)
Building on the knowledge gained in the previous lab, this session covered more advanced design patterns, including:

   * Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
   * Singleton: As mentioned before, ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
   * Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   * Template Method: Defines the structure of an algorithm but allows subclasses to redefine certain steps.
   * Composite: Represents objects in a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.

## How to Use this Repository

Each laboratory folder contains materials specific to that lab, including lecture slides, exercises, my solutions, and additional resources.
